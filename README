dnf-extra-tests
===============

dnf-extra-tests is a set of tests which have not been merged into `DNF
<https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf>`_ (yet?).

This serves as an ad hoc solution to where to store scripts that execute
e.g. integration or system tests that may affect the system on which
they are running.

These scripts are free and open-source software; see the section License
to understand the terms and conditions under which you can use, study,
modify and distribute dnf-extra-tests.


Features
--------

Refer to the test suite for the complete list of all the features. I
have, nevertheless, mentioned one of them below in hope of gaining your
attention:

- test managing different install roots
- test tracking of previous runs
- test release version substitution

The tests are not in the final shape yet. Further tests are added on
demand if they fit the purpose of the repository.

Contributions
-------------

Since I am a bit demanding person and I want to avoid any unnecessary
conflicts, I don't accept any contributions. On the other hand, once
it turns out that there is a potential contributor, I'll move the
repository under https://github.com/rpm-software-management/ where the
contributions can be accepted.
